## Why? 

You can [do these searches yourself](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/wasapp/ipp2/startPers.do) on the DMV website, but you have to fill out a long form before searching for your desired name (which will likely already be taken). Then you'll have to start over again, filling out that same form from scratch every time you want to search.

Enter robots! Our automated friends that exist to perform exactly this kind of mind-numbing drudgery.
